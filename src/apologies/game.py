"""
Classes that track game state.

Note that these classes track game state, but do not implement game rules.  The
only validations are to prevent changes that literally cannot be represented in
game state, such as selecting an invalid square.  All other rules (such as the
restriction that only one pawn can occupy a space, or the act of sliding down a
slider, etc.) are implemented in the play module, using the methods available on these
classes.

Attributes:
    ADULT_HAND: The size of a hand of cards for an adult-mode game

    PLAYER_COLORS(list): All available player colors, listed in order of use
    PAWNS(int): Number of pawns per player
    SAFE_SQUARES(int): Number of safe squares for each color
    BOARD_SQUARES(int): Number of squares around the outside of the board
    CARD_1: Name of the 1 card
