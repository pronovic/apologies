        Choose the next move for a character.

        There is always at least one legal move: a forfeit.  Nothing else is legal, so the
        character must choose to discard one card.  In standard mode, there is effectively no
        choice (since there is only one card in play), but in adult mode the character can choose
        which to discard.  If a move has an empty list of actions, then this is a forfeit.

        The source `must` return a move from among the passed-in set of legal moves.  If a source
        returns an illegal move, then a legal move will be chosen at random and executed.  This way,
        a misbehaving source (or a source attempting to cheat) does not get an advantage.  The game
        rules require a player to make a legal move if one is available, even if that move is
        disadvantageous.
