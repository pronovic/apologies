[Apologies](https://gitub.com/pronovic/apologies) is a Python library that
implements a game similar to the [Sorry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorry!_(game)) board 
game.  It includes a console demo that plays the game with automated players,
intended for use by developers and not by end users.

It also serves as a complete example of how to manage a modern (circa 2020)
Python project, including style checks, code formatting, integration with
IntelliJ, CI builds at GitHub, and integration with PyPI and Read the Docs.
