This is a Python library that implements a game similar to the [Sorry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorry!_(game)) board game.  On UNIX-like platforms, it includes a console demo that plays the game with automated players, intended for use by developers and not by end users.

It was written as a learning exercise and technology demonstration effort, and serves as a complete example of how to manage a modern (circa 2020) Python project, including style checks, code formatting, integration with IntelliJ, [CI builds at GitHub](https://github.com/pronovic/apologies/actions), and integration with [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/apologies/) and [Read the Docs](https://apologies.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Developer documentation is found in [DEVELOPER.md](DEVELOPER.md).  See that file for notes about how the code is structured, how to set up a development environment, etc.
