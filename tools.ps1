# Commands for use as IntelliJ or PyCharm external tools on Windows
#
# The run script works fine from a Git Bash shell, but isn't easy to invoke
# from IntelliJ or PyCharm as an external tool.  This script duplicates the
# behavior from the run script for the things that I want to be able to invoke.
# It intentionally does *not* duplicate all of the behavior in the run script.
# For more information, see the notes in DEVELOPER.md.
#
# Run like: powershell.exe -executionpolicy bypass -File tools.ps1 format
